# Architecture docs
> Last full markdown audit: 2026-05-22 (v0.29 shipped — loading-screen-owned RAF, final-path all-painting warm, full-size presented-frame gate, UI prebuild, and museum-neutral default lighting; lint/build pass).

## v0.29 — shipped loading-screen ownership architecture

The shipped updatening target is a strict boot gate: loading overlay stays active until the main RAF loop is running, the final-size composer path has presented frames, every painting has been drawn through the production path, and first-use UI/control states have been prebuilt. See `../../plan.md § v0.29` and `../../FINDINGS.md § v0.29`.



## v0.23 — Performance/Preloading Planning Audit

This Markdown file was refreshed during the 2026-05-21 all-docs sync. The current runtime is still v0.22; the open performance work is documented in `plan.md § v0.23`, with source-referenced audit notes in `FINDINGS.md § v0.23`. Key boundary: v0.22 improves the first 15 artworks, but large-gallery GPU warming, synchronous procedural map generation, and best-effort idle prefetch remain planned N-series work.

## v0.22 — shipped (2026-05-21) — Improved Preloading + Press-to-Start

Current status: shipped. Runtime now preloads albedo plus PBR texture sets for the first 15 artworks under the loading overlay, warms each cached artwork texture set on the GPU before reveal, keeps the branded loader visible for at least 500 ms, and waits for the accessible "Galerie betreten" button before entering the gallery. Validation: `npm run lint` and `npm run build` passed after implementation; `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` still reports the known Vite/esbuild development-server advisory that requires a semver-major upgrade.

## v0.21 — implementation shipped (2026-05-21)

Current status: shipped. The v0.21 plan is implemented in runtime code and documentation: branded progress loading overlay, Three.js LoadingManager progress, pre-reveal GPU warm render + awaited shader prewarm, audio `preload='auto'`, adjacent/idle PBR prefetch, lighting resume clamp, WebGL restore status, max-texture diagnostics, shader precision guard, 16K importer guidance, global pointer tracking, timeline arrows/counter/edge fades/responsive sizing/virtualized large-list rendering, and cleanup for added global listeners. Future-only boundaries remain LOD/tiled streaming for device-limited 16K detail and grouped/page timeline navigation for very large exhibitions.


## v0.20.8 — Complete v0.20 implementation shipped (2026-05-21)

Current status: shipped. The v0.20.7 gap-closure plan is now implemented in code and this file was refreshed during the all-markdown sync. Remaining v0.20 audio/control quality gaps are closed: fade targets clamp to the 0.30 effective-gain ceiling, diagnostics include display percent, preference patching updates non-slider controls during volume drags, sliders expose German percent value text, zero-volume recovery logs stored/recovered values, first-interaction recovery also covers pre-play audio, unmute resumes within `BackgroundAudioManager`, slider fill CSS stores percentages, and the ended-loop fallback fade is shortened to 50 ms. F-09 was confirmed correct and required no code change.

## v0.18 — Customer sidecar text shipped (2026-05-20)

Current status: shipped. The importer (`scripts/import-artworks.mjs`) reads same-basename `.txt` sidecars (`.md` accepted as a backup) and merges customer-facing metadata into the generated manifest. Asset fields (`id`, `image`, `webglImage`, `dimensions`) remain importer-owned. Canonical plan: `plan.md § v0.18`. Research log: `FINDINGS.md § 2026-05-20`. Customer guide: `docs/CUSTOMER_TEXT_GUIDE.md`. Template: `customer-artworks/ARTWORK_TEXT_TEMPLATE.txt`.

Use this folder for deeper architecture notes when a future change adds or revises a subsystem. Keep module ownership, validation requirements, and customer-preview impact explicit.

## 2026-05-19 audit notes

- Current root map remains authoritative for module ownership.
- Legacy interaction files are intentionally listed as deferred cleanup, not active architecture.
- Preference persistence, diagnostics, Page Lifecycle handling, and generated preview ownership are now part of the architecture baseline.
- Online platform assumptions are documented in [`../../FINDINGS.md`](../../FINDINGS.md).
