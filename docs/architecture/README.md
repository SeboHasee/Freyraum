## v0.20.5 status

Customer audio-file ingestion is implemented, but runtime audio behavior is still under repair. Current architecture focus: separate target loudness from live element loudness, replace the mapping contract with the requested `0..30% effective` range, keep both sliders on one source of truth, and relocate quick controls away from the rejected current position. Canonical references: `plan.md § v0.20.5`, `FINDINGS.md § 2026-05-21`.

## v0.18 — Customer sidecar text shipped (2026-05-20)

Current status: shipped. The importer (`scripts/import-artworks.mjs`) reads same-basename `.txt` sidecars (`.md` accepted as a backup) and merges customer-facing metadata into the generated manifest. Asset fields (`id`, `image`, `webglImage`, `dimensions`) remain importer-owned. Canonical plan: `plan.md § v0.18`. Research log: `FINDINGS.md § 2026-05-20`. Customer guide: `docs/CUSTOMER_TEXT_GUIDE.md`. Template: `customer-artworks/ARTWORK_TEXT_TEMPLATE.txt`.

Start with [`../../ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) for the current repository map.

Use this folder for deeper architecture notes when a future change adds or revises a subsystem. Keep module ownership, validation requirements, and customer-preview impact explicit.

## 2026-05-19 audit notes

- Current root map remains authoritative for module ownership.
- Legacy interaction files are intentionally listed as deferred cleanup, not active architecture.
- Preference persistence, diagnostics, Page Lifecycle handling, and generated preview ownership are now part of the architecture baseline.
- Online platform assumptions are documented in [`../../FINDINGS.md`](../../FINDINGS.md).
