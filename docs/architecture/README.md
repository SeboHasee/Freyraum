# Architecture docs

## v0.18 — Sidecar text plan ready (2026-05-20)

Technical coding plan: `plan.md § v0.18`. Customer guide: `docs/CUSTOMER_TEXT_GUIDE.md`. Template: `customer-artworks/ARTWORK_TEXT_TEMPLATE.txt`. Only `scripts/import-artworks.mjs` changes.


Start with [`../../ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md) for the current repository map.

Use this folder for deeper architecture notes when a future change adds or revises a subsystem. Keep module ownership, validation requirements, and customer-preview impact explicit.

## 2026-05-19 audit notes

- Current root map remains authoritative for module ownership.
- Legacy interaction files are intentionally listed as deferred cleanup, not active architecture.
- Preference persistence, diagnostics, Page Lifecycle handling, and generated preview ownership are now part of the architecture baseline.
- Online platform assumptions are documented in [`../../FINDINGS.md`](../../FINDINGS.md).
