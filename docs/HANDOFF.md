# FREYRAUM Handoff Guide

This guide covers current handoff and support operations.
Historical release-by-release details are in `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/archive/`.

## What to hand off

- Current runtime behavior and constraints (reference `README.md`).
- Configuration behavior (`docs/QUERY_PARAMETERS.md`).
- Customer import/update workflow (`docs/CUSTOMER_PICTURE_GUIDE.md`, `docs/CUSTOMER_TEXT_GUIDE.md`).
- Architecture ownership (`ARCHITECTURE_MAP.md`).
- Open active work (`plan.md`) and active findings (`FINDINGS.md`).

## Support diagnostics workflow

1. Reproduce issue with exact browser/device context.
2. Collect diagnostics via the documented diagnostics API in `docs/QUERY_PARAMETERS.md` (`exportJson()` preferred).
3. For performance/regression reports, run the tools documented in `docs/REGRESSION_TOOLING.md` (`checkInvariants()`, `startPerf()` / `stopPerf()`, and `checkTier1Thresholds()` where applicable).
4. Confirm whether behavior is expected under current startup mode/config.
5. If behavior differs from docs, treat as drift and update canonical docs in the same fix PR.

## Handoff checklist

- [ ] Current behavior validated against runtime code
- [ ] Canonical docs linked (not duplicated)
- [ ] Customer-facing instructions verified end-to-end
- [ ] Known risks and deferred upgrades linked from maintenance docs
