# FREYRAUM Plan

## Documentation Rule

For this repository, every meaningful implementation must update the markdown documentation together with the code.

Minimum documentation updates for future work:

- update `plan.md` with current scope, findings, implemented items, and remaining items
- update `CHANGELOG.md` with a dated summary of shipped changes
- update `FINDINGS.md` with important technical observations and limitations
- update `README.md` when user-facing setup, controls, or workflow changes
- update `DOCUMENTATION_RULES.md` when the documentation process itself changes

## Current Baseline

- Root `index.html` is the one-click local launcher.
- `customer-preview/app.html` is the committed local customer preview.
- `app.html` is the Vite development entry.
- The local preview is built as a classic IIFE bundle so it works from `file://`.
- Demo artwork is currently embedded placeholder content for offline preview stability.

## Findings

### Local Preview Findings

- A Vite dev entry cannot be opened directly from `file://` because the browser cannot execute the raw TypeScript/module graph.
- A committed preview build is required if the customer should be able to launch the demo with one click.
- Relative script/style paths and a classic script bundle are the safest local preview format.

### Interaction Findings

- Previous zoom limits allowed the camera to move too close to the artwork plane.
- Previous pan limits were hardcoded and did not respond to aspect ratio or current zoom level.
- Portrait artworks therefore hit vertical inspection limits too early, while extreme zoom could reveal empty space.
- The side preview meshes used a fixed geometry size, which stretched non-square artwork ratios.
- Touch interaction only supported swipe navigation and pinch zoom; it did not support one-finger pan while zoomed in.

## Implemented Now

### Local Preview Foundation

- Added a one-click local launcher in root `index.html`.
- Added committed static preview output in `customer-preview/`.
- Added a separate Vite development entry in `app.html`.
- Added `vite.local.config.ts` and preview HTML generation.
- Replaced remote preview dependencies with embedded placeholder artwork and procedural material input for reliable offline demos.

### Interaction & Gallery Fixes

- Added shared texture sizing helpers in `src/utils/texture.ts`.
- Main artwork sizing now stores fitted artwork width/height after aspect-ratio preservation.
- Zoom is now clamped dynamically so the camera cannot move through or unrealistically inside the artwork.
- Pan is now clamped from real artwork dimensions, camera FOV, viewport aspect ratio, and current zoom level.
- Mouse hover rotation now stays available at every zoom level, with reduced intensity during deeper zoom.
- Mouse drag now pans when panning is possible and falls back to subtle rotation behavior when not.
- Touch interaction now supports one-finger panning when zoomed in and swipe navigation when not zoomed in.
- Side preview panels now preserve aspect ratio instead of stretching textures.

## v0.01 Scope

### v0.01 Implemented

- local one-click customer preview
- offline-safe placeholder artwork setup
- dynamic zoom clamp
- dynamic pan clamp
- touch pan while zoomed
- aspect-ratio-safe side previews
- documentation baseline for changelog, findings, and rules

### v0.01 Still Open: Technical Implementation & Execution Plan

This plan turns the remaining v0.01 scope into vertical slices. Each slice must produce a working, reviewable increment that includes code, local preview output, documentation, validation notes, and customer-facing behavior where applicable.

#### Vertical Slice Rules For v0.01

- Do not implement broad horizontal refactors without visible product value in the same slice.
- Each slice must update source code, `customer-preview/` when runtime behavior changes, and the markdown files that describe the change.
- Each slice must define its own acceptance checks before implementation starts.
- Each slice should remain small enough to be completed by Claude 4.7 or GPT 5.5 in one focused pass.
- If a slice uncovers larger architecture work, document it under "Reserved Future Pass" instead of expanding v0.01.

#### Slice 1 — Final Local Artwork Asset Pipeline

Goal: replace embedded placeholder artwork with final optimized local assets while keeping offline preview reliability.

Implementation targets:

- create a local asset folder such as `src/assets/artworks/` or `public/assets/artworks/`
- replace placeholder data URI usage in `src/config/artworks.ts` with local asset references
- extend artwork metadata with asset dimensions, alt text, credit/source fields, and delivery notes
- ensure `TextureManager` continues to preload all artwork assets before the loading overlay exits
- keep `customer-preview/` fully self-contained after `npm run build`

Acceptance checks:

- `npm run build` succeeds and emits local artwork files in the preview bundle/output
- root `index.html` still opens the preview without a development server
- every artwork displays with correct aspect ratio in the main mesh, side previews, and timeline
- `FINDINGS.md` records any asset-size or compression tradeoffs

Reserved Future Pass:

- CMS upload UI
- remote asset CDN integration
- advanced responsive image generation beyond the local preview need

#### Slice 2 — Accessibility Motion & Contrast Controls

Goal: make the presentation safer and clearer for users who need reduced motion or stronger contrast.

Implementation targets:

- add an application-level preferences module for motion and contrast state
- read `prefers-reduced-motion` and map it to scene/UI animation intensity
- add a visible high-contrast overlay mode or theme class on the root app element
- reduce hover rotation, transition amplitude, loading spinner animation, and panel motion when reduced motion is active
- strengthen glass panel opacity, text contrast, and button borders for high-contrast mode
- document the supported accessibility preferences in `README.md`

Acceptance checks:

- reduced-motion users get no large animated transitions or spinning loader animation
- high-contrast mode keeps text and controls legible over bright and dark artwork
- controls remain visible and usable at all zoom levels
- `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass

Reserved Future Pass:

- full WCAG audit
- persisted user preference storage
- advanced theme editor

#### Slice 3 — Explicit Zoom & Reset View UI

Goal: add visible controls so users are not dependent on mouse wheel or pinch gestures.

Implementation targets:

- expose gallery methods for zoom in, zoom out, reset view, and current zoom state
- add a `ZoomControls` UI component under `src/ui/`
- include buttons for zoom in, zoom out, and reset view
- place controls where they do not overlap navigation, timeline, or info panels
- ensure buttons work with mouse, touch, keyboard focus, and screen-reader labels
- keep pan and zoom clamped through existing `GalleryManager` safety rules

Acceptance checks:

- zoom buttons cannot exceed the same min/max limits as wheel and pinch zoom
- reset view returns pan, zoom, and hover rotation to the safe default framing
- controls stay available at all zoom levels
- local preview output is rebuilt

Reserved Future Pass:

- zoom slider with exact percentages
- minimap / overview navigator
- saved view positions per artwork

#### Slice 4 — Keyboard-Accessible Timeline & Focus Styles

Goal: make artwork navigation usable without pointer input.

Implementation targets:

- update `src/timeline/Timeline.ts` so timeline items are real buttons or have equivalent ARIA roles
- add roving tabindex or another clear keyboard model for timeline navigation
- support Enter/Space selection and arrow-key movement across thumbnails
- add visible focus styles in `src/styles/main.scss` for timeline, navigation, zoom, and fullscreen controls
- preserve active artwork state for screen-reader announcements
- avoid breaking existing click/touch timeline selection

Acceptance checks:

- keyboard-only users can reach every timeline item and select it
- focus state is visually obvious against the glass UI
- active item state is programmatically and visually clear
- no duplicate tab stops are introduced

Reserved Future Pass:

- full screen-reader narration pass
- translated ARIA labels
- automated accessibility testing setup

#### Slice 5 — Lightweight WebGL Fallback Screen

Goal: show a useful fallback when WebGL is unavailable instead of failing silently.

Implementation targets:

- add a small feature-detection function before renderer creation in `src/main.ts`
- check WebGL support and handle renderer initialization failures
- create a fallback UI component or inline fallback screen with plain HTML/CSS
- explain the issue and suggest enabling hardware acceleration or using a modern browser
- keep fallback compatible with `file://` local preview

Acceptance checks:

- app shows a readable fallback if WebGL cannot initialize
- normal WebGL-capable browsers still load the gallery unchanged
- fallback copy is documented for customer support

Reserved Future Pass:

- non-WebGL static gallery mode
- server-side generated fallback screenshots

#### Slice 6 — Quality Presets For Integrated GPU / Battery Mode

Goal: provide predictable performance controls for weaker devices without changing the visual direction.

Implementation targets:

- create quality preset definitions for high, balanced, and battery/integrated GPU mode
- connect presets to renderer pixel ratio, post-processing bloom, shadow settings, and geometry/detail where safe
- use `getOptimalPixelRatio` as the starting point, not a parallel system
- add a UI selector only if it can be implemented without cluttering the presentation
- document default preset choice and manual override behavior

Acceptance checks:

- low preset visibly reduces GPU cost by lowering pixel ratio and expensive post-processing
- high preset preserves current presentation quality
- changing presets does not reset artwork selection unexpectedly
- preview build remains stable from `file://`

Reserved Future Pass:

- automatic FPS measurement and adaptive quality switching
- detailed device benchmarking

#### Slice 7 — Timeline Thumbnail Aspect Ratio & Loading States

Goal: make timeline thumbnails visually stable and consistent with the side preview aspect-ratio fix.

Implementation targets:

- use artwork metadata dimensions to decide thumbnail fit behavior
- choose a documented default between contain, cover, or framed contain for thumbnails
- add loading/skeleton state before images finish loading
- avoid layout shift when thumbnails load
- keep active and focus states readable over all thumbnail formats

Acceptance checks:

- portrait, square, landscape, and ultra-wide thumbnails no longer look unintentionally stretched
- thumbnails reserve stable dimensions while loading
- timeline remains scrollable and usable on narrow screens
- implementation is documented in `FINDINGS.md`

Reserved Future Pass:

- generated thumbnail derivatives
- responsive thumbnail density controls

#### Slice 8 — Fullscreen Toggle & Presentation Mode Polish

Goal: support customer presentation use without browser UI distractions.

Implementation targets:

- add a fullscreen/presentation control in `src/ui/`
- use the browser Fullscreen API with graceful fallback when unavailable
- add presentation mode styling for reduced clutter if fullscreen is active
- ensure Escape/browser fullscreen exit updates UI state correctly
- keep navigation, zoom, reset, and timeline controls reachable while presenting

Acceptance checks:

- fullscreen can be entered and exited without breaking WebGL rendering or layout
- UI state updates when fullscreen exits through browser controls
- presentation mode does not hide critical controls permanently
- behavior is documented for customer demos

Reserved Future Pass:

- kiosk mode packaging
- multi-screen presenter controls

#### Slice 9 — Structured Artwork Metadata Model For Future CMS

Goal: prepare the content model for later CMS integration without adding a CMS yet.

Implementation targets:

- replace the minimal `Artwork` interface with a structured model that includes stable id, title, subtitle, description, dimensions, alt text, credits, tags, and asset paths
- keep a local static data source as the canonical v0.01 content source
- update all consumers: info panel, timeline, gallery preload, side panels, and future documentation screenshots
- document which fields are required now and which are reserved for future CMS use

Acceptance checks:

- TypeScript catches missing required artwork fields
- existing gallery UI still works with the new metadata model
- local preview still works offline
- `FINDINGS.md` records CMS-readiness boundaries

Reserved Future Pass:

- live CMS API loading
- editorial admin workflows
- localization fields and translation management

#### Slice 10 — Customer Handoff Screenshots & Architecture Diagrams

Goal: make the project easier to review and hand off to non-developers.

Implementation targets:

- create a documentation asset folder such as `docs/assets/`
- add current local-preview screenshots generated from the committed preview
- add a simple architecture diagram covering launcher, preview build, source app, asset pipeline, and documentation flow
- link screenshots and diagrams from `README.md` and `plan.md`
- document how screenshots should be regenerated after visual changes

Acceptance checks:

- screenshots reflect the current committed preview
- architecture diagram explains the local preview and development build paths clearly
- documentation remains useful when viewed directly on GitHub

Reserved Future Pass:

- automated screenshot generation in CI
- branded customer PDF handoff deck

#### Recommended v0.01 Execution Order

1. Slice 9 — Structured Artwork Metadata Model For Future CMS
2. Slice 1 — Final Local Artwork Asset Pipeline
3. Slice 7 — Timeline Thumbnail Aspect Ratio & Loading States
4. Slice 3 — Explicit Zoom & Reset View UI
5. Slice 4 — Keyboard-Accessible Timeline & Focus Styles
6. Slice 2 — Accessibility Motion & Contrast Controls
7. Slice 5 — Lightweight WebGL Fallback Screen
8. Slice 6 — Quality Presets For Integrated GPU / Battery Mode
9. Slice 8 — Fullscreen Toggle & Presentation Mode Polish
10. Slice 10 — Customer Handoff Screenshots & Architecture Diagrams

This order starts with the data model and local assets because later UI, thumbnails, accessibility labels, and documentation screenshots depend on stable artwork metadata.

## Reserved Future Pass After v0.01

- advanced canvas shader refinement
- content management integration
- multilingual content pipeline
- audio narration and accessibility audio layer
- analytics and multi-gallery support
- experimental WebGPU / VR path

## Verification Notes

- `npm run build` should regenerate the committed local customer preview.
- `npm run lint` should remain clean except for the known TypeScript parser support warning from current dependency versions.
- Interaction fixes should be manually tested in both `npm run dev` and by opening root `index.html` locally.
